# Part 0: Prerequisites Check & Quick Setup

**Duration: 5-10 minutes**  
**Purpose: Verify you can access GitHub Codespaces - no local installation needed!**

## ðŸŽ‰ Great News: No Local Installation Required!

This workshop uses **GitHub Codespaces** - a cloud-based development environment that runs in your browser. This means:

- âœ… **No software to install** on your computer
- âœ… **Same environment for everyone** - no "it works on my machine" issues
- âœ… **Access from any device** with a web browser
- âœ… **All tools pre-installed** and ready to go
- âœ… **Works on any operating system** (Windows, Mac, Linux, even tablets!)

## Quick Prerequisites Check

### What You Need (That's It!)

**Required:**
- [ ] **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge - latest version recommended)
- [ ] **Stable internet connection** (for accessing GitHub and Codespaces)
- [ ] **GitHub account** (free - we'll create this in Part 1 if you don't have one)

**Optional but Helpful:**
- [ ] **Second monitor or device** (tablet/phone for viewing instructions while coding)

### Test Your Browser

Copy and paste this into your browser's address bar to test JavaScript (required for Codespaces):

```
javascript:alert('âœ… JavaScript is working! You\'re ready for Codespaces.')
```

If you see a popup message, you're all set! If not, make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.

### GitHub Codespaces Availability Check

GitHub Codespaces is available to all GitHub users with:
- âœ… **Free accounts**: 120 core hours per month (more than enough for this workshop)
- âœ… **All regions**: Available worldwide
- âœ… **All devices**: Works on desktop, laptop, tablet, and even phones

## What We'll Set Up in Part 1

Since we're using Codespaces, Part 1 will be much faster! We'll only need to:

1. **Create GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Create other service accounts** (Netlify, Claude AI)
3. **Launch your Codespace** (pre-configured with all tools)
4. **Quick tour** of the development environment

## Accounts You'll Need

We'll create these free accounts in Part 1:

- [ ] **GitHub**: https://github.com (for code hosting and Codespaces)
- [ ] **Netlify**: https://netlify.com (for website deployment)
- [ ] **Claude AI**: https://claude.ai (for AI coding assistance)

## What's Pre-installed in Your Codespace

Your GitHub Codespace will come with everything ready:

- âœ… **Node.js & NPM** (latest LTS version)
- âœ… **Git** (pre-configured)
- âœ… **VS Code** (browser-based, with extensions)
- âœ… **Terminal** (built-in)
- âœ… **Astro** (will be installed when we create the project)
- âœ… **All necessary extensions** for web development

## Browser Requirements

### Recommended Browsers (Best Experience)
- **Google Chrome** (latest version)
- **Microsoft Edge** (latest version)
- **Mozilla Firefox** (latest version)

### Supported but with Limitations
- **Safari** (works but some features may be limited)
- **Mobile browsers** (works for viewing, limited for coding)

### Not Supported
- **Internet Explorer** (not supported by GitHub)
- **Very old browser versions** (update to latest)

## Internet Connection Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Stable connection** (no specific speed requirement)
- **Ability to access GitHub.com** (check if your network blocks it)
- **WebSocket support** (most modern networks support this)

### Test Your Connection
Visit https://github.com in your browser. If it loads properly, you're ready!

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't access GitHub"
- Check if your network/firewall blocks GitHub
- Try using mobile hotspot if on restricted network
- Contact your IT department if on corporate network

### "Browser feels slow"
- Close unnecessary tabs and applications
- Try a different browser
- Restart your browser

### "JavaScript disabled"
- Enable JavaScript in browser settings
- Disable ad blockers temporarily if they're blocking scripts
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

## Ready to Start?

If you can:
- âœ… Access https://github.com in your browser
- âœ… See the JavaScript test popup above
- âœ… Have a stable internet connection

Then you're ready to proceed to [Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment](01-setup.md)!

**No downloads, no installations, no command-line setup needed!** ðŸš€
